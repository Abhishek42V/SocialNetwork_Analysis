# SocialNetwork_Analysis

This project aims to analyze an email communication network using various centrality measures while comparing different sampling techniques. The dataset, sourced from a European research institution, is modeled as a directed graph, where nodes represent email addresses and edges indicate email exchanges. We explore the impact of sampling methods (e.g., random, snowball, shortest-path) on network centrality metrics such as degree, closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality. Additionally, we investigate community structures using clustering algorithms. The results will highlight how sampling techniques influence network properties and insights.
