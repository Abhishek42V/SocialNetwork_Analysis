# SocialNetwork_Analysis

This project aims to analyze an email communication network using various centrality measures while comparing different sampling techniques. The dataset, sourced from a European research institution, is modeled as a directed graph, where nodes represent email addresses and edges indicate email exchanges.The impact of sampling methods (e.g., random, snowball, shortest-path) on network centrality metrics such as degree, closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality is explored. Additionally,investigation of community structures using clustering algorithms is proposed. The results will highlight how sampling techniques influence network properties and insights.

The dataset for the above analysis can be found at the following url:
